# Tokenization
## Description-
This Python script employs regular expressions to analyze text. It includes functions to detect word patterns and tokenize text. The main function showcases these functions using an example text, printing the detected words and tokens. The script demonstrates how regular expressions can be utilized for text processing tasks.
## Explanation-
    -detect_word_patterns function: Uses a regular expression to find all words in the input text. It returns a list of words.

    -tokenize_text function: Utilizes a regular expression to tokenize the input text, considering words, spaces, and non-alphanumeric characters as separate tokens. It returns a list of tokens.

    -main function: Demonstrates the usage of the two functions with an example text. It prints the detected words and tokens.

    -__name__ == "__main__" condition: Ensures that the main function is executed when the script is run, not when it's imported as a module.
